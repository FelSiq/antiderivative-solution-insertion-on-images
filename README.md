# math-expressions-detection-and-solution
Detection and solution of mathematical expressions in photos using image processing techniques.

# Abstract
The premise is to identify mathematical expressions from photos, parse it, and insert its solution inside the image (preferably at the end of the detected mathematical expression.) I'll just focus in supporting just some mathematical operations (mostly arithmetic), and also leave the mathematical solution to Wolfram Alpha. My focus is on the detection of the mathematical expression itself and the recognition of its digits/operators in the correct order.
