# Title
Detection and solution of antiderivatives and insertion in-place in photos using image processing techniques.

# Abstract
The premise is to identify antiderivatives (because proper integrals seems to be harder) from photos, parse it, and insert its solution inside the image (preferably at the end of the detected object.) I'll just focus in supporting just some mathematical operations (mostly arithmetic) and, of course, also leave the mathematical solution to Wolfram Alpha. My focus is on the detection of the antiderivatives itself and the recognition of its operations in the correct order.

# Expected image processing technologies
- Object detection (for the antiderivative expression itself)
- Digit and Operator recognition

# Sample inputs
Here some examples of expected program inputs.
